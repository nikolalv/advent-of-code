# Advent Of Code

 https://adventofcode.com/2019

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## Commit Frequency?

Every day two new problems are released, the second one is unlocked after you solve the first. The goal is to solve all 50.
That means you'll be seeing 1-2 commits a day from me. 

**Edit** I lied and got caught up in assignments
